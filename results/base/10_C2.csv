tutor,"Tap-shoer, shoehorn, or shoehorn!
",C2
student,"Hahaha) Yes, I was looking for tap-shoer as well but it didn't come up. What does this word mean in English?
",C2
tutor,"It helps you put on shoes easier.
",C2
student,"Okay! Thanks)
",C2
tutor,"You're welcome. How are things going with your little one?
",C2
student,"He is a wonderful boy! I love him so much!) Thank you for asking)) He's got some problems at school, but the teachers are trying to help him through it, so we wait and see if it will work out) But he has never been that keen on going to school.
",C2
tutor,"What age is he?
",C2
student,"4 years old
",C2
tutor,"Does he have a good relationship with his teacher?
",C2
student,"He loves her, she's very kind and patient with him) He also had a little sister in the nursery beforehand, but she was sent to another school. I think it would be better if he could go there as well, so they can have fun together.) And he is a little bit older than most children his age in the class, which may contribute to his behaviour problems
",C2
tutor,"That's right! It happens with us all the time, we always want what our child has) So when he starts school, it will be more challenging.
",C2
student,"Well, I have to say that since the last month or so he is much better in class. He's calmed down a bit and listens well.
",C2
tutor,"Great! That's wonderful!) He was probably tired from being at home for so long.
",C2
student,"That's true) We also spend more time with him now, we play with him more and talk to him a lot. But still, sometimes he doesn't want to go to school
",C2
tutor,"Of course it'll be hard! And what's even harder is that the children are getting bigger so he feels like a baby next to them) I can imagine this must have been very frustrating for you. Have you tried taking him with you?
",C2
student,"Yes, we do take him but still he refuses going into school sometimes.
",C2
tutor,"Oh dear!) Well, then you need to think of another solution. Maybe he'd like it better if he had his own classroom or group?
",C2
student,"Hahaha) I guess that wouldn't work either:) He would probably want to stay at home all the time with us:)
",C2
tutor,"Ah, well then you have a problem!) You will have to ask him if there is something that he doesn't like about school. If so, try to change it somehow. Also, be sure to talk to his teacher and ask her to watch out for him in class)",C2
student,Thanks! That sounds good! I think we will make an appointment with the teacher later this week),C2
