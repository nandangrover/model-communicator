tutor,"### 24 November 2016You could say 'pumpkins'. Or, if you wanted to sound British/American/Australian (and make a distinction between the fruit and the vegetable), you would say 'pumpkin's'.
",C2
student,"I see! It is weird when you want to be precise. In Italian you never have to worry about this :)
",C2
tutor,"### 24 November 2016Exactly, you don't have to think twice when you write/speak in Italian ;)
",C2
student,"And I suppose it depends on whether you are using the English language for a practical purpose or not. In German, precision is almost mandatory; but in English it can be left out if you don't care about being precise :)
",C2
tutor,"### 24 November 2016That is really interesting! Yes, I suppose that is true, although there are certainly situations where you need to make your point as precisely as possible.
",C2
student,"In German precision is mandatory in any situation: if you're not precise enough it can be taken for granted by the other party (which may lead to misunderstandings).
",C2
tutor,"### 24 November 2016Yeah, this is something I find really interesting about languages. Italian is full of exceptions and 'cultural rules', so you always have to think twice when speaking or writing in Italian...
",C2
student,"Yes! And that's why it is much more efficient (at least if you already know the language).
",C2
tutor,"### 24 November 2016So, what about English?
",C2
student,"Well, I like to think of English as being a bit more 'practical'.
",C2
tutor,"### 24 November 2016Mmmm... I guess that is also true :)### 24 November 2016I see your point! But English is not only efficient in terms of precision (as you've already pointed out), but it is much more practical. Italian has a lot of exceptions and 'cultural rules', which is why you always have to think twice when speaking or writing in Italian...
",C2
student,"Yes, I like the idea that you can 'just say it'. You don't necessarily need to be precise in English :)
",C2
tutor,"### 24 November 2016Yes! And that's why it is much more efficient (at least if you already know the language).
",C2
student,"I see your point. In fact I like that you can 'just say it'. You don't necessarily need to be precise in English :)### 24 November 2016Exactly! And this makes English a bit more practical than Italian, at least in certain situations.
",C2
tutor,"### 24 November 2016Hmmm... I see what you mean.
",C2
student,"Yes, I do!
",C2
tutor,"### 24 November 2016Yeah, and this is one of the things that makes me feel like English is more practical than Italian.
",C2
student,"Exactly!! I think it's funny when people speak about precision in language learning...I always find it so interesting how languages influence our lives and how we 'think'.
",C2
tutor,"### 24 November 2016Interesting point! So, what do you think of this idea that English is more practical than Italian? I guess that's true :)### 24 November 2016I see your point! And this makes English a bit more practical than Italian, at least in certain situations.",C2
