",C2
student,"Yeah...so you are from Ukraine? I was reading a bit more about this country, which is so different from mine (Switzerland)...I mean, it is great that you can speak so many languages, but it seems like a difficult life for someone who has to change countries, leave their family behind and start from scratch.
",C2
tutor,"Yes, sometimes it is hard...and in the beginning I was feeling homesick quite often. But with time things get better, as long as you have supportive friends around you :) So are you going to Switzerland?
",C2
student,"Yes, finally we're moving there in May :) And I am sure that you will like it! After all, you live here ;)
",C2
tutor,"Well, let's see :) But yes, I think I will enjoy the fresh air and clean air...especially since I have to move out from my house after living with my parents for so many years. So where in Switzerland are you going?
",C2
student,"I am moving to Bern firstly (and then probably to Zurich).
",C2
tutor,"It is great! I hope we can still meet here and there :) I live here too, but in the outskirts of the city...not so far away from you. Well, what else? Are you going to stay in Switzerland for good?
",C2
student,"Yes. My wife already has a job offer from a big company, so she is leaving Ukraine as well.
",C2
tutor,"That's great! You must have found your life partner at last ;)
",C2
student,"Yes...we did :) And I will have to start working full time soon. But anyway, we are planning to stay in Switzerland for good.
",C2
tutor,"That sounds like a nice plan! If you ever need some advice about finding work or learning the local language don't hesitate to ask me ;)
",C2
student,"Thanks :) I guess I will do just that :) And what else?
",C2
tutor,"Nothing much...except working on my book ;) But I think we'll finish this conversation soon, so you can go back to your reading.
",C2
student,"Oh! Well...it is nice talking with you again :)## References[1]
