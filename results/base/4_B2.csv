tutor,"No problem! Here are some examples of things that could make us feel impressed/bothered (sorry for spelling mistake): • Someone is good at something - we can use 'about' or 'by'. • We have to do lots of work - again, about or by.

",B2
student,"That's ok - but what about the other prepositions?
