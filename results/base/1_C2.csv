tutor,"Well, let me think...\section{}\strong{I believe that ""there"" is always followed by an indefinite pronoun such as ""one"", ""two"", etc.}
",C2
student,"Okay, thanks. Now I would like to ask about 'The students have gone' vs. 'The student has gone'.
",C2
tutor,"The first sentence (plural form) doesn't make sense because you don't know which students have gone, so it should be the other way round
",C2
student,"Okay, thanks for the tip! What about \strong{I am going to play} vs. \strong{I will play}? Should I put a full stop at the end of my sentences?
",C2
tutor,"Yes, you would be better off with a period, but that's not what we were talking about
",C2
student,"Right! So this is one more thing to remember! Now let's try some 'I' and 'me' constructions. I think \strong{You are me} should be written as \strong{You and me}. But what about \strong{I am you}, shouldn't it be \strong{I and you}?
",C2
tutor,"Nope, not in this case. ""I"" is used to denote the subject of a sentence, while ""me"" denotes someone else
",C2
student,"That makes sense! Now let me ask about some prepositions... I don't know whether 'At home' or 'In the house', as far as I remember from school days, is more correct?
",C2
tutor,"It depends on your native language. English is quite flexible with its rules, but you shouldn't be using ""at"" at all. In general terms it should be ""in"". If you are speaking about a particular place you might say ""At home"", but in most contexts it would be ""In my house/apartment"".
",C2
student,"Oh! I didn't know that! Now let me ask about some idioms... What about 'The cat is out of the bag', for example?
",C2
tutor,"Yes, this one is tricky. It means that something which was secret has now been revealed.
",C2
student,"Okay, but what about 'To be in a fix'? Should it be 'being in a fix'?
",C2
tutor,"That would be fine!
",C2
student,"What do you think about \strong{You are on your own} vs. \strong{You are by yourself}, and is there any difference between them, or should we use one or the other interchangeably?
",C2
tutor,"Nope, no difference at all in this case. I suppose it's not the most used phrase though...
",C2
student,"Okay! So if I were to choose a single word among 'by myself', 'alone', and 'on my own', which one would you suggest?
",C2
tutor,"Well, I guess that depends on context. In a formal setting ""alone"" or ""on your own"" might be better choices than ""by yourself"", but it's a matter of taste. I don't really know though... I suppose we can leave this for now
",C2
student,"No problem! And what about 'I will make sure you are okay', or \strong{You have got to do it} vs. \strong{You must do it}? Shouldn't they both be written as \strong{You must do it}?
",C2
tutor,"You can say either one, but I think that the latter is more formal",C2
student,Okay! So should I go for the past tense or present tense form of 'I will make sure you are okay'?,C2
