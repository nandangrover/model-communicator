tutor,"In Italian you say ""panella"", panella (or ""pane e mandorla"" which would be ""bread with almonds"").
",C2
student,"Right. But why are there two words for it? And what about ""pane e zafferano""? Why do we need both 'pane' and 'zafferano' if they mean the same thing?
",C2
tutor,"Well, I don't know much about this matter but I've heard that Italian has a rich variety of words to say things which could be said in fewer words. Italians like their language and they tend to make it more colourful than other languages.
",C2
student,"Yes, that's what I hear too. Maybe that's why English is so much easier for me! ;)
",C2
tutor,"English is certainly a lot easier...
",C2
student,"Well, I wouldn't say it's easier but I think you should practice more with your language. And you know what? Italians don't have any problems learning our language because they know how to speak in fewer words than we do :) That way, we can use the same word for something and still say different things...
",C2
tutor,"I guess it's because you have to speak about a lot of abstract ideas in Italian? But you know what is even more difficult - German verbs!
",C2
student,"Yes. Especially when they are conjugated in 3rd person, plural and past tense :) English verbs can be confusing too but at least their forms are logical...
",C2
tutor,"Yes, but German has so many different verb endings!
",C2
student,"Well, I've studied Russian as well. And Ukrainian. And Polish. And English.
",C2
tutor,"You speak all these languages? That is impressive!
",C2
student,"Well, my mother and father spoke to me in Polish. Then I started learning English. Later I moved to Russia and then Ukraine...
",C2
tutor,"Oh, you lived there for a long time? In Crimea or Kiev?
",C2
student,"No, actually in Donetsk :) I was born here :) But when I was 7 years old my parents decided we should move to Poland. That's where I finished elementary school and high school. Then I studied linguistics at university. Finally, I moved back to Ukraine. All that time I was working as a private tutor...
",C2
tutor,"Oh, you are an expert in English grammar! :) And do you know what? It's really impressive how you speak all these languages but your pronunciation is so good and clear!
",C2
student,"Yes, thank you :)
",C2
tutor,"Well, let me ask you some questions. Do you have a job nowadays?
",C2
student,"No. I work as an English teacher.
",C2
tutor,Really? That's great! And where do you live?,C2
student,In Ukraine. Kiev.,C2
