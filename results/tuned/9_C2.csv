tutor,"Thank you. Well done for noticing that! So far, so good. But can you tell me why the title is spelt correctly? Why doesn't it have a hyphen in between 'shoots' and 'and'?
",C2
student,"Well, I think it should be spelled ""eats shoots and leaves"" because the panda eats first, then shoots and leaves afterwards.
",C2
tutor,"Good point! But that would mean the animal was left-handed (or had an unusual accent!) No, the correct spelling is 'eats, shoots and leaves'. That's because it's a phrasal verb which means to do one thing before doing another; in this case, eating first then shooting.
",C2
student,"So if I understand you correctly, the correct spelling of 'eats shoots and leaves' is 'eats shoots and leaves'! That must be right because it's in a book by Lynne Truss!
",C2
tutor,"Yes, but this is not the final word on the matter. A quick Google search reveals that Lynne Truss herself agrees with you about the spelling of her book title.
",C2
student,"But if I were to look at the dictionary entry for 'eats shoots and leaves', I would expect it to be spelled correctly in a dictionary, wouldn't I? So shouldn't Lynne Truss agree with the dictionary?
",C2
tutor,"Well yes that's true. The Oxford English Dictionary says ""eats, shoots and leaves"".
",C2
student,"So you are saying that 'eats, shoots and leaves' is correct, but that it isn't right in Lynne Truss' book?
",C2
tutor,"Well no, I am not saying that. As far as the meaning of this phrasal verb goes, both versions are right!
",C2
student,"So if I understand you correctly, the spelling of a phrase like 'eats shoots and leaves' can depend on whether it's being used in a sentence or in a book title?
",C2
tutor,"No, that's not what I meant to say at all.
",C2
student,"Well if you don't mind me asking, why do you think this is the case?
",C2
tutor,"Well, to explain it properly we need to look at some grammar rules concerning phrasal verbs.
",C2
student,"What are phrasal verbs?
",C2
tutor,"Good question! Phrasal verbs are combinations of a verb and one or more prepositions like ""eat"", ""shoot"" etc.
",C2
student,"So if I understand you correctly, a combination of a verb with a preposition is called a phrasal verb?
",C2
tutor,"That's right! The preposition in the sentence is what determines whether the phrase is used transitively (when it requires an object) or intransitively (when it doesn't). If you have ever learned Spanish, you will know that this is similar to the difference between ""ir"" and ""irse"".
",C2
student,"Well I am not so familiar with Spanish grammar, but I see your point.
",C2
tutor,"Good! Now let me explain how Lynne Truss spells out a phrasal verb in her book title. She is using it transitively, which means that she requires an object (in this case ""leaves""). In order to show the verb being used intransitively (without any object), we would need to use 'eats, shoots and leaves'.",C2
student,"So if you want to spell a phrasal verb with no object using a hyphen, you would write it like that?",C2
