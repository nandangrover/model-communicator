",B2
student,"Hey!
",B2
tutor,"What is it?
",B2
student,"I have an idea
",B2
tutor,"Go on...
",B2
student,"'relieve', is also to make something easier or to reduce the effort in doing something, so it's like ""easier/reduced"" which can be translated into any language!
",B2
tutor,"That's true - you are right. It can take on different meanings in different contexts and for different purposes...so do you have a favourite word?
",B2
student,"I have to say, yes it is 'relieve'.
",B2
tutor,"Why is that?
",B2
student,"Because it has the same meaning as ""easier"" or ""reduced"".
",B2
tutor,"OK - so if we were to translate 'relieve' into a different language...what would you expect them to say (or write)?
",B2
student,"I don't know.
",B2
tutor,"Let's try then: what is the most common thing people do with relieve?
",B2
student,"That's easy! They use it when they want to make something easier or reduced for them!
",B2
tutor,"Great! So if you wanted to reduce your effort in doing something...what would be a good translation of 'relieve' then?
",B2
student,"Well, I can think of ""reducir"" (reduce) and ""menos"" (less)!
",B2
tutor,"OK - that sounds like it could work. But what about when you use 'relieve' to mean 'easier', for example in an ad. For painkillers you would say 'pain relief'.",B2
student,That's right! So...,B2
tutor,"Let's go through them then, and look at some examples of how it can be used...what about relieve as ""reduce""?",B2
student,It is easy to reduce something if you have less.,B2
