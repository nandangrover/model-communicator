tutor,"Yes, it's all about tradition and culture. Even though English isn't much easier than German when it comes to noun genders...
",C2
student,"I think you are right!I am using the following code in order to achieve this, but it is not working. The output should be: `
",C2
tutor,"Well, it may sound easier than German at first glance, but if one doesn't know about gender rules in English it can get very complicated for sure!
",C2
student,"I see :)
",C2
tutor,"Yes, and you can also run into some tricky words like 'bank', 'banque' or 'banksy'. Also 'toast', 'chess'...
",C2
student,"I was going to say, it would be a bit more logical to have separate words for each case rather than trying to remember which word should be used where.
",C2
tutor,"Yes, you are right! But then again, that is why German is so tricky! It has three genders and only six cases but still there are exceptions everywhere...
",C2
student,"Exactly :) I have another question about gender in English - can a masculine noun be feminized? For example 'shepherd' or 'bullfighter'. Or would we rather say 'female shepherds' and 'male bullfighters', like in French, for instance?
",C2
tutor,"Yes, yes indeed! You are right! English is tricky when it comes to gender too :) And this is just a small example of how difficult it can be.
",C2
student,"Do you have any tips or tricks regarding feminization/masculinization in English? I'm currently writing an essay on the topic but don't really know where to begin...
",C2
tutor,"Well, it seems like you are already familiar with one way of masculinizing a noun - replacing 's' by 'z'. For example, 'teacher' becomes 'teazer', and that is what I use in my writing too! But it only works for certain words.
",C2
student,"Can you give me an example?
",C2
tutor,"Well, the word 'sheep' could be replaced with 'zeep'.
",C2
student,"Thank you so much :) I have another question - can we apply masculinization to a noun that already has a masculine gender? Like, for instance 'shoe' or 'chair' which are both masculine in English. How would we feminize them?
",C2
tutor,"You are right! The word 'chair' is indeed masculine in English :)
",C2
student,"Yes, and that is why I am asking - how do we make it feminine?
",C2
tutor,"Well, you can replace the last letter with a 'y', like this: chair becomes chairy. It is actually quite easy when you know what to look for! And I would say it is easier than in German where every noun has to be determined by gender and case!
",C2
student,"So, we could feminize 'chair' too? :)
",C2
tutor,Yes indeed! We can replace chair with chairy. It is not only easy but also quite funny!,C2
student,And if I wanted to masculinize a word like 'dog' - would I have to change it into doge?,C2
