tutor,"Exactly :) In fact, it's much better than just using the verb 'to be', which is not always needed...
",C2
student,"I see, thanks!
",C2
tutor,"I should mention that this is also why some languages have more words for bread (or any other object) in their dictionaries than English has. Because there are many different ways of saying it. :)
",C2
student,"I guess because bread is one of the most important ingredients, so you want to be very careful with what you use and how you describe it...
",C2
tutor,"Exactly! And you're right about being careful, too. :)
",C2
student,"So, let me see if I get this right. Pumpkin seed is a noun. Bread is an adjective that modifies pumpkin seed. Correct?
",C2
tutor,"Yes! That's correct...
",C2
student,"And bread can be a verb as well, so you have to know when and how it becomes a verb...
",C2
tutor,"Right! In the first sentence we used it as a noun; in the second one as an adjective. :) And yes, English speakers would get confused about this sentence if they didn't already understand the meaning of bread from context.
",C2
student,"I see...so you can even use 'bread' as an adverb!
",C2
tutor,"Exactly! It means something like 'with'. :)
",C2
student,"So, in a sentence like ""I made my own pumpkin seed bread with whole flowers"" it sounds more natural to me if I put 'pumpkin seed bread' before the noun and 'whole flower bread' after. But I guess the English speaker wouldn't be able to tell apart both versions unless he/she already knew the meaning of bread...
",C2
tutor,"That's right :) And for this reason, most languages will have many different ways of saying it! :)
",C2
student,"Well that makes sense. Now I see why some languages have more words in their dictionaries to describe one ingredient like bread.
",C2
tutor,"Exactly! :)
",C2
student,"So is 'pumpkin seed' a noun or adjective? I mean, we could also use it as an adverb...or maybe even an adjective that modifies both 'seed' and 'bread'.
",C2
tutor,"Correct! It can be used as any of those :)
",C2
student,"So, when you want to emphasize something in English you say ""it is the XYZ thing"" right?
",C2
tutor,Yes. Exactly :),C2
student,"I see...so why do we have this expression 'pumpkin seed bread' instead of just saying 'pumpkin bread with seeds'. Would it be wrong or weird to use 'pumpkin seed bread', even though it means the same thing?",C2
