tutor,"That's right! Well done! So what are your thoughts on punctuation?
",C2
student,"I think it's a funny thing because it is not always clear-cut as to where one should put it. As you have already mentioned, it could be considered that a punctuation mark makes the sentence much clearer. For example, in the sentence: 'I am very afraid', 'fear' and 'very' are two separate sentences!
",C2
tutor,"Indeed! But I would like to point out that there is more to punctuation than just commas and full stops. There are dashes, semicolons etc...
",C2
student,"yes, I see what you mean. However, as a native English speaker, my main issue with punctuation is that it is not really consistent in British vs American English. For example, in some cases, the British use a hyphen when an American would write two separate words. For instance 'pre-teen'
",C2
tutor,"That's right! And vice versa - you have to be careful where you place your commas and semicolons too! The difference between the British and the Americans is probably one of the biggest challenges for a person learning English as a second language.
",C2
student,"yes, I agree with you on that point! I was wondering whether there were any particular grammar rules or punctuation rules that you would suggest I pay attention to?
",C2
tutor,"As I said before, it is very important to be consistent when using commas and semicolons. For example, if you are writing a passage in which one person is talking about another, you should use 'said' instead of 'says'. However, if the person doing the speaking is unknown (as in most cases) then we would say ""He said...""
",C2
student,"okay! I will pay attention to that next time. Thank you for your help!
",C2
tutor,"No problem! Remember, it is always good to try and write a passage yourself so you can see what works best for you.
",C2
student,"yes, I think I understand now, thanks again!

",C2
student,"Yes, punctuation is one of those things that I have never fully understood. The Oxford comma and so on... Is there a mistake in that last sentence you copy-pasted?
",C2
tutor,"Not really, but when I first read it, I thought that you stopped being afraid that this was the American spelling as in 'you were not afraid anymore'
",C2
student,"ha...so a grammatically correct sentence, but with a weird meaning...a comma was missing.
