tutor,"Hmmm, interesting. I don't really feel like I can use the word ""pumkins"" but at least in English we don't have to put an apostrophe after it!
",C2
student,"Yeah true, I also feel weird when having to write ""pumpkin's"". In fact as a German I actually prefer to write ""Pumpkin's"".
",C2
tutor,"Yeah?
",C2
student,"I know some Germans that would probably be okay with this too, but still...
",C2
tutor,"Interesting. When I think about it I suppose that the same thing happens in English and Italian!
",C2
student,"Well I guess so (English) or no (Italian), you can't really put an apostrophe after a plural form!
",C2
tutor,"Haha yes indeed, but we still use it..
",C2
student,"Yeah.I mean, why should we? It makes no sense to me..
",C2
tutor,"Well I would say that in English the word ""pumpkin"" comes from Latin (like all Germanic languages), so we could easily imagine a plural form with an apostrophe, but it doesn't exist!
",C2
student,"Hmmm yeah! That makes sense. I think it was just an idea of my teacher at school..
",C2
tutor,"Well, that might be because the word pumpkin comes from English (as you said), and in German it is called ""KÃ¼rbis"" which doesn't exist in Italian either!! So the apostrophe got introduced into Italian from English!
",C2
student,"That would make sense.
",C2
tutor,"Yeah I know, we were just discussing how language works. How it gets influenced by others...
",C2
student,"I know it can be confusing..especially for people learning a foreign language with an inflected one like German or Italian.
",C2
tutor,"I know! The way words change in meaning and pronounciation is so much more obvious than the way they are spelled (at least in English)..
",C2
student,"Yeah, I agree it is sometimes difficult to make sense of it all..
",C2
tutor,Exactly!! It can be confusing. But it is also very interesting!,C2
student,Indeed...,C2
tutor,"Haha anyway, what do you think about the pumpkin thing? Do you like the idea of an apostrophe? Or should we just use ""pumkins""?",C2
student,"Well I'd say that ""pumpkins"" sounds a bit weird..but I can imagine it!",C2
