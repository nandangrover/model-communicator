",B2
student,"yes, but I found it very difficult
",B2
tutor,"Ok... so let's look at the two charts together - and start with the first one! Can you describe Australia's use of 'coal' as a percentage of total electricity in Australia? Can you do that? Good! You were able to say this much. Now can you describe the change in Australia between 1980 and 2000 (as shown on your second chart)? Do want me to give you a bit of help? Try something if you can though!
",B2
student,"yes, I've just got confused with all the words
",B2
tutor,"Ok - try again!
",B2
student,"oils accounted for 10% in electricity production in 1980 and decreased to 6% in 2000

student,"I'm sorry, I couldn't find it
