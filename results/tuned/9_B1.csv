tutor,"Ok,so you have the words 'coal' and 'fuel'. Now you need to find a suitable phrase between those two words.
",B1
student,"But what if we dont have any more fuel?
",B1
tutor,"Oh yes ...but this is not going to happen!
",B1
student,"How do you know? I mean it really can happen. And in that case we could use 'a lot' instead of 'all' as in 'coal will be needed for a long time'
",B1
tutor,"Yes,yes of course..sometimes it does happen but not now! It is enough to use 'all' here because the time period is unknown and unspecified.
",B1
student,"So I can write fuel source coal or ...?
",B1
tutor,"Nope you dont need a conjunction between them. They are two different ideas. You shouldnt join them with any connecting word. So just put one of those words, not both!
",B1
student,"Oh I see...I thought that maybe 'coal' could be the source for the 'fuel'.
",B1
tutor,"But here it isnt possible! In this case we would have to use the word 'fuel', so its impossible to put 'coal'.
",B1
student,"So then fuel source coal is correct? I mean I know that you said it should be just one of them, but I was wondering if it really was wrong or not.
",B1
tutor,"Nope! That's a complete sentence here and it should begin with 'fuel'.### 2018.05.31So you want to talk about sources that provide energy in general? Or specifically nuclear power plants?
",B1
student,"Yes,specifically.
",B1
tutor,"Ok..so what are the other sources of energy besides nuclear power plants? You can use 'fuel' here too because its not only about coal or oil! So now you know it is possible to use both words separately! And remember that if you want to talk about something specific,you shouldnt just repeat the words fuel and source like a title fir the charts you know
",B1
student,"Ohh I see...but why do we need two sentences? Isnt it better ti write one single sentence instead of two separate ones? What would be the difference between them?
",B1
tutor,"Nope, they are different. The first sentence is about sources and it is possible to use 'coal' or 'fuel' here! But in this case we have to say what kind of source of energy that is...in this case nuclear power plants! And the second sentence is also correct but its only about coal/oil and it should begin with 'fuel'.
",B1
student,"Oh ok So I can write fuel source nuclear power plant or ....?
",B1
tutor,"That's right! Nuclear power plants are a specific example of energy sources. It is good to use this phrase for a title fir the charts you know, but in your case its not needed so you shouldnt repeat it!
",B1
student,"Ok I see...So how can I write 'a lot'?
",B1
tutor,"Good! Now you can say ""coal will be needed for a long time"" instead of ""all coal"". And also remember that sometimes its possible to use both words separately, but here we need one single sentence. If we have to talk about more than one thing or idea then we need only one word and not two words!",B1
student,Ok I see...so why did you say '50 units of electricity from coal' is enough?,B1
