student,"Oh...sorry.I was typing an example in the chatbox.
",B2
tutor,"Thanks - I understand what you mean by 'really' but it's more usual to say 'very' or 'extremely'.
",B2
student,"Thank you! And ""really"" is only used for strong emotions?
",B2
tutor,"Yes, if you are angry, really annoyed etc. Otherwise use stronger words like ""extremely"".
",B2
student,"Sorry...can I ask you a question please??
",B2
tutor,"Sure - go ahead!
",B2
student,"I'm not sure about how to spell this word, is it ""involve""?
",B2
tutor,"Yes, that's right. The opposite would be 'exclude'.
",B2
student,"Sorry... I don't understand the explanation. Could you please repeat it again??
",B2
tutor,"Sure - I'll try to explain better. If you want to say that something is a little bit boring then use 'bored of', but if you are really bored by something then 'bored with'. 'Bring up' is ok for past tense, 'bring forth' is more formal and 'brought about' sounds the most like the other verbs.
