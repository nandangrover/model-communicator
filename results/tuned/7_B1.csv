tutor,"I think it’s funny when people are over confident or arrogant because they don't know anything about a subject, but just like to talk... I was in the same situation as my tutor.That sounds interesting - what do you mean?My student didn't find any example to describe her feelings..so she gave me some examples and then I asked her if they were right or wrong!
",B1
student,"yes, but over confident is also good...I don't know why.
",B1
tutor,"Well, it depends on the context - it's not always a nice thing. So let’s try to find an example to describe how someone might sound when they are overconfident?
",B1
student,"Over confident means that you are too sure of yourself. So I think arrogant is more like a word which can be used for the same situation!
",B1
tutor,"Yes - it's great to know what the words mean before using them...how do you know that someone sounds confident?I know they sound overconfident because sometimes they are wrong and then they are too sure of themselves.
",B1
student,"Exactly I think so but...sometimes they don't admit when they are wrong or they try to find an excuse...so, it can be difficult to judge if they really are confident or not!
",B1
tutor,"It’s interesting that you say this because overconfidence and arrogance have very different meanings - so how do we describe someone who is overconfident?
",B1
student,"I think they can sound confident but it's more like being sure of themselves.
",B1
tutor,"Yes, exactly! So it could be OK to say that someone sounds overconfident if you don’t really know them or what their opinions are...or maybe someone else makes them feel confident?
",B1
student,"Hmmmmm.. I don't think so because they can sound like they are confident but in fact they have no confidence. So it would be wrong to say that they are overconfident!
",B1
tutor,"Maybe you mean they seem to know a lot about something, even though they really don’t?
",B1
student,"That's right! For example, some people who are over confident in English because they think they know more than they actually do...they are just trying to make themselves sound better than they really are. It's like pretending to be someone you're not!
",B1
tutor,"Yes exactly - that’s a good way of describing it. So, how can we describe people who are over confident when they don't know what they are talking about?
",B1
student,"Exactly! Someone might sound like they have confidence but in fact they really don't...So I think if you don't know something very well, and someone asks you a question that requires some knowledge about it then it can be quite difficult to find the right words to describe how confident you feel.
",B1
tutor,"It’s important to make sure you are being clear with your answers! So what would you say when you want to describe someone who is overconfident?
",B1
student,"Hmmmmm I'm not sure but probably it can be OK to use the word arrogant - it might sound better in some situations...it could mean that they just don’t know enough about something and are trying to make themselves seem cleverer than they really are! I think overconfident would only be appropriate if you knew them well.
",B1
tutor,"Yes, exactly – it is much more polite to use the word arrogant if you don't know someone very well...So how do we describe people who have no confidence at all?
",B1
student,"Well I think that they can sound confident but in fact they really are not. They might say things like 'I'm sure' or 'I'm certain', but in fact it’s a lie!
",B1
tutor,Interesting – so is there any particular word we use to describe someone who has no confidence?,B1
student,"Yes, I think it can be OK to say that they are timid. They might seem confident and they may have some knowledge about something but in fact they really don't! So when you meet people who seem quite sure of themselves but don’t actually know much at all – they could just be pretending.",B1
