tutor,"Ok, so what do you think about that time for next week then? I'm afraid I won't be able to accommodate any other requests :)
",C2
student,"Well I would prefer 9:30 too, but if we have no option I can do it at 14.
",C2
tutor,"Ok, great! That sounds like a plan :) I will send you an email next week with the necessary information :) See you then!### Tuesday June 2nd
",C2
student,"Hi, this is me (I forgot to put my name in the previous message... Sorry!)
",C2
tutor,"hi there, thanks for your mail! How did it go last time?
",C2
student,"I don't know what you mean :) Do you want me to be honest about what happened during the class or just tell you a little about it (I don't know if it is relevant)
",C2
tutor,"I am sorry, that was perhaps not the best way to put it! I wanted to ask how your last lesson went... did you do your homework? (I forgot to tell you at the end of our last session that I would send you some exercises which you should complete prior to our next class.
",C2
student,"Well, actually I didn't prepare for the class as it was a bit late to start thinking about it... So I just looked over what we were doing in the class and wrote my answer for you.
",C2
tutor,"Sorry! I wasn't aware that your homework had been so late! It will be very important this time then, to have something prepared prior to our lesson :) Would you like me to send you an email with some exercises today?
",C2
student,"Well actually if you don't mind, we could start a little later and I can look over them in class (and let you check my answer at that point)
",C2
tutor,"That sounds good! What time would suit you better? 10.30 or 11?
",C2
student,"Hmmm... Can't decide actually, so I guess we could go for both :)
",C2
tutor,"Hi there!
",C2
student,"Hi!
",C2
tutor,"Great! How was it?
",C2
student,"Well to be honest, it wasn't great :) Firstly the internet connection at my place is very bad and kept disconnecting. Secondly I found out that we were talking about things I had not prepared for so I was struggling a bit...
",C2
tutor,"Sorry! I forgot to send you some exercises before our last class (I think it would have helped us focus on the right thing in class)... Would you like me to send them today?
",C2
student,"That sounds good actually. And if possible, could we start a little later this time as well, please :) I will be very busy today so 11am won't work out too badly ;)
",C2
tutor,Well that's ok then :) I have sent you some exercises to do before our next class! Let me know what time suits you better!,C2
student,"Hi there, I am sorry for the delay in replying to your last email, it just slipped my mind...",C2
