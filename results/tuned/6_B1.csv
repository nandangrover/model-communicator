student,"Yes <TEACHER>, I agree with you. It's hard for me to say good things about myself. But it is easy for me to say bad things about my self!haha
",B1
tutor,"You think so? Well, let's try and look at the words you can use to describe people's personality...what do they all mean?
",B1

",B1
tutor,"OK...well let's look at the words you can use to describe people's personality. First, we need to work out what these words mean in English. Let's do some writing and then we can discuss it. Do you have a pen?<STUDENT>, yes <TEACHER>. OK...we'll start with 'lazy'.

",B1
student,"<TEACHER>, I think you are lazy! haha
",B1
tutor,"No, I just don't have time for cleaning my room...it's easier to leave it dirty and then spend some time cleaning it.
",B1
student,"OK<TEACHER>, but what about 'selfish'?haha
",B1
tutor,"It means that someone is only interested in their own interests, without caring about other people's feelings or needs...or they don't care if other people are happy.
",B1
student,"Well <TEACHER> you are selfish!haha
",B1
tutor,"No - I just want to get a nice job and then have enough money for myself, not for everyone else!!<STUDENT>, you can do it too?
",B1
student,"Of course, because I'm lazy!haha
",B1
tutor,"OK<STUDENT>...now look at these words again. How would you describe yourself using these words? Write down your thoughts and then we'll have a discussion about them...
",B1
student,"Well <TEACHER>, I like to take a rest, because my life is very busy and stressful!haha
",B1
tutor,OK<STUDENT> - so let's look at 'selfish'. You said that you don't care if other people are happy. Is this true?,B1
