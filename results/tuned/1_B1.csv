student,"Well, in my opinion, it depends on the context and who says what...

tutor,"OK, you can leave that one out for now if you like…. <STUDENT> - so I was going to read these sentences out to see if you think they have a negative meaning: (a) The director is very assertive; he always wants his own way. OR (b) The director is very determined, he won't take no for an answer.

student,"Well, it's actually quite easy. The only difficult one I think was 'ambitious'.
",B1
tutor,"OK – so I think you’re trying to say that it’s not always a bad thing if someone has these traits?!  <STUDENT> - So do you want to try saying some of them yourself? Or is it too early in your English learning journey?!
",B1
student,"Well, you know what? In my opinion, I think we should have the same opinion about this sentence.
",B1
tutor,"Good – can you say any others? OR what about...  <STUDENT> - OK so let’s look at this sentence again (from before)...I'd say 'he's assertive' would be positive, but if someone said 'he's always assertive' I'm not sure it has a good meaning.
",B1
student,"Well, if someone says 'I always tell the truth', I don't like it too much...
",B1
tutor,"So why do you say that?!
",B1
student,"Exactly! <STUDENT> - So what about these two sentences (from before)? I think 'he's determined' would be positive, but 'he's always determined' not really.

",B1
tutor,"Exactly! <STUDENT> - So what about these two sentences (from before)? I think 'he's determined' would be positive, but 'he's always determined' not really.Yeah OK – so why do you say that? Do you have any examples?
",B1
student,"Well, it’s actually quite easy. The only difficult one I think was 'ambitious'. It depends on the context and who says what…
",B1
tutor,"OK good! So what is your advice for students of English as a second language then? Do you have any final comments on these adjectives?! <STUDENT> - Well, I think it's better to avoid always in these kinds of situations…Yes that makes sense – but why do you say that?!
",B1
student,"Well, it’s actually quite easy. The only difficult one I think was 'ambitious'. It depends on the context and who says what…
",B1
tutor,"OK so can we look at some more positive examples now? Or is it too early in your English learning journey?! <STUDENT> - I don't know, if you want to. Maybe later...
