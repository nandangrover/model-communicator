tutor,"Well, we have here ...<STUDENT> 25% increase since the beginning of this century (in coal production) and it was mostly because of China's rapid growth at that time! And now Australia is trying to get away from being a one-coal country. And it looks like they are succeeding as we see here ...<STUDENT> gas has started taking over in the last few years.

",B1
student,"Ohhhh ok :)
",B1
tutor,"And it looks like what we see here ...<STUDENT> ...they are succeeding as we see here that coal is still in the top three of primary energy sources. Gas is getting more and more popular but coal production has increased again since 2014! Could you say something about this?
