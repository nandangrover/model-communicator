tutor,"That is an interesting one. Let me look at it again. Yes, indeed it looks odd... I don't know whether or not it's grammatically incorrect. It sounds strange to say 'there are two teachers', but since you asked about AI and GEC I would go with the book
",C2
student,"Oh! You see, I meant that in Italian the sentence is correct, we use a lot of words from Latin origin... I guess I should have been more precise before asking. Well then what about 'there are two teachers', do you think it's right?
",C2
tutor,"Yes, definitely...
",C2
student,"Oh! Ok then, let's move on to the next one, then. Do you know any other words like this? I'm sure there is a pattern...I don't want to spend too much time on it, but I would like to be able to use it in my writing and speaking
",C2
tutor,"Yes, I have found some of these myself. Let me think about them for a second. Hmm... Well, how about 'there are two teachers'?
",C2
student,"Ah! So you do agree that there is something wrong with the sentence 'There are two teachers in class'?
",C2
tutor,"Nope. I still don't see any reason to change it
",C2
student,"Oh! Ok then, let me explain again. This is what I mean, actually. There are two teachers (noun)...in class (preposition)
",C2
tutor,"Ah, ok... So, you think that 'in class' should be used in this case?
",C2
student,"Exactly! The same as it is in Italian
",C2
tutor,"Oh! I see what you mean now. So you are saying that the preposition 'in' implies a specific position or place (as in 'in school')? In your opinion, then, we should use it to emphasise the fact that they are located inside a classroom and not somewhere else.
",C2
student,"That is right! I have also found something similar in other languages...it would be nice if English was like this too!
",C2
tutor,"Well, as far as I know 'in' usually has this meaning. So we could say that you are asking for the word to acquire a different sense in your language. How do you think it should change?
",C2
student,"That is right (I have found something similar in other languages...it would be nice if English was like this too!). Yes, I would like for 'in' to have two meanings instead of just one...to clarify that they are in a specific place and not somewhere else.
",C2
tutor,"Ok, then... let me think about it some more
",C2
student,"So what do you think? Are there any other words like this that we can use? I would like to be able to use them all the time!
",C2
tutor,"Well, you have already given an example of a word like this (in the phrase 'there are two teachers in class')...so I don't see why not. As long as it is a noun and you want it to have more than one meaning...I guess that would do. There might be some others...I will think about them later, though
",C2
student,"Ok then! Thanks for your help
",C2
tutor,No problem! Have fun with the AI you're working on,C2
student,"Oh yeah! I am actually planning to go to Italy in September (I have been offered a job there) and so it will be great practice!Etichette: English, Italian",C2
