tutor,"Yes, impress (or amazed) is an emotion - it means to feel something very strongly - which is why you use 'about'. OK then - try the other pair now!
",B2
student,"Oh, I'm bored by his work! It's always so repetitive and predictable...
",B2
tutor,"Good job! Now think of a sentence with pleased and disgusted. 
",B2
student,"I don't know... I think pleased is when you are happy about something but disgusted means the opposite, right?
",B2
tutor,"Yes exactly - please try it out now!
",B2
student,"I was delighted to meet her! She's really cool!
",B2
tutor,"Yes that's it! I'm glad we got this straightened out. Now can you tell me about a sentence with happy and sad? 
",B2
student,"Happy means excited, so I'd say I was happy when I saw my dog again! And sad is when you feel really down - I guess you could use 'sad' for that but it doesn't sound right to me.
",B2
tutor,"You are right about the excited one - and good job with the other two too! OK, now try out these last two: surprised and confused (I can't think of a better example for this)
",B2
student,"OK I was surprised when I saw her new haircut. But confused is when you don't know what to do in a situation?
",B2
tutor,"Yes that's it! Let me ask you something - if we say ""I'm surprised by the news"", does that make sense to you? 
",B2
student,"Yeah, because I think surprised means very surprised. 
",B2
tutor,"Exactly! OK so finally - are there any words here which have two meanings and can be used in both ways? 
",B2
student,"Well 'annoyed' could mean angry or frustrated! But 'confused' is always confusing, right?
",B2
tutor,"Yes I agree with you. Now let me ask you this - if we say ""I was annoyed when she interrupted"", does that make sense to you? 
",B2
student,"Yeah, it sounds about right. 
",B2
tutor,"Exactly! And now, can you try and think of a sentence with 'annoyed' in the context of someone being frustrated or angry. 
",B2
student,"OK I was annoyed by my sister because she always has to do everything first... <pause>... and it makes me so mad!! 
",B2
tutor,"Yes that's exactly right! OK then, let's finish this section with a final example! Imagine you are at school - your teacher says ""I was confused about the questions you asked"" what is he saying? ",B2
student,That's a little confusing... but I think he means they were good and interesting. ,B2
