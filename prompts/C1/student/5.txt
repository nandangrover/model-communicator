Tutor: ok
Student: When I finished my masters I worked as a volunteer teaching Spanish to African inmigrants and then I realised I really enjoyed teaching. It was too late, I had already spent 7 years at university studying something else I wish I had studied a Masters in Spanish as a second language
Tutor: OK I see - good grammar by the way! - I guess teachign positions in Spain are quite controlled. Did you ever teach Spanish in the uK?
Student: Yes, it's always easier to teach Spanish in another country. I had some students, I used to teach at home. I also taught in a early years school. It wasn't a subject, it was a Club How can I say that properly??
Tutor: Um...do you mean like an after-school club?
Student: Exactly
