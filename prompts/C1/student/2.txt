BUT one of them is not quite right – I mean the idea of the past simple is correct but you haven’t used it correctly….Which one?? Which verb I mean..so e.g. the first one ‘was’ is OK…) Here is your answer: I was very happy of the whole trip, even through we were not obey the plan that we wrote before. because we took the wrong train in the morning, we had to change the plan. OK!
Student: no,,I can see the records of last class in this chat box( before we break .)
Tutor: Yes me too - that's OK don't worry about it - try my question on the your past tenses ok?
Student: ok - I am very happy of the whole trip ( because the feeling is happen now ) - we were not obey the plan that we written before. because the behaviour of write plan was happened before obey the plan, right?
Tutor: OK thanks <STUDENT> - well not impossible I guess your first idea (I am happy) BUT I was happy was good! What about 'we were not obey'?? What's the main verb here?
