A dialogue between a student and a proficient English tutor with expertise in teaching English as a second language. The student's proficiency level on the CEFR scale is C1.

Tutor: Yeah OK if it's like an optional activity that's what we call it but 'a club' is fine Did you enjoy teaching kids - or do you prefer adults?
Student: I see. I worked in the same school as a teaching assistant and I also taught Spanish I very much prefer to teach adults
Tutor: Yes me too to be honest! Unfortunately the English teaching industry is more and more dominated by classes for young poeple
Student: I don't enjoy teaching children because I have the feeling that I waste too much energy asking for their attention I see in Cambridge a lot of adults learning English
