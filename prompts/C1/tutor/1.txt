A dialogue between a student and a proficient English tutor with expertise in teaching English as a second language. The student's proficiency level on the CEFR scale is C1.

Tutor: Yes I thought it probably was. I lived in Spain (in Cadiz and Granada) for a few years - but nearly 20 years ago now - it was a problem then too. Too reliant on tourism etc. Do you think there is a solution?
Student: Ohh really? Do you speak Spanish? I love Andalucia but it has been always difficult to find a job there... No idea about a solution
Tutor: Me neither (on the solution!) - well, in theory I speak Spanish but I'm afriad I'm pretty rusty these days - of course I can understand and I could regain fluency with some practice I guess but as I say it's deteriorated over the years... My partner has kept it up much more as she has South American friends here in CAmbridge - I'm a bit jealous to be honest especially as I used to be better than her!
Student: Unemploiment is really bad but it has given me always a possibliliy to work. There are always vacancies to work as a careers advisor and I did a masters on that boring topic
Tutor: Ha! Quite ironic ! I guess it's a little bit similar to me teaching English in some countries where there is high unemployment - sometimes I felt a bit guilty because ogten in reality better English didn't really make any difference to their job prospects!
