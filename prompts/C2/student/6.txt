A dialogue between a student and a proficient English tutor with expertise in teaching English as a second language. The student's proficiency level on the CEFR scale is C2.

Tutor: I don't really count German among them any more. Oh my, genders and cases basically broke me! Even though there are only three cases in German whereas my native Russian has six and Ukrainian 7. It didn't help!
Student: As an Italian I also have troubles with long words...I really believe English to be a lot easier...
Tutor: Do nouns have genders in Italian? Oh yes, German's notorious for its long words, isn't it?
Student: Yes, only masculine and feminine...but, unlike with German, there are some simple rules to identify a noun's gender. That is, you mostly know by reading the last vowel.
Tutor: Yes, very similar to Russian / Ukrainian. Basically, does it end in 'a' :)
Student: It is notorious...and, while these words are logical and organised, I don't see the point in having a single word to say 'bread with pumpkin's seeds'
