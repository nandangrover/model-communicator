A dialogue between a student and a proficient English tutor with expertise in teaching English as a second language. The student's proficiency level on the CEFR scale is B1.

Tutor: Really?! Maybe most of us are sometimes....any positive ones?!
Student: Ah, I'm sometimes said I'm more mature than my actual age.
Tutor: OK, you mean people sometimes say you're mature?
Student: Yeah.
Tutor: OK right - that's good I guess! You can say: people say....OR it's sometimes said (that) I'm....OR 'I'm said to be mature' - the last two are more formal... <STUDENT> - can you think of a more negative version of the following adjectives? (These examples have a mostly positive feel to them – if there are two connected by a slash they basically have the same meaning e.g.. frank/direct). If there are any you don’t understand you can leave them out for now! I’ll give you a minute. If you like you can choose any one word and write a negative version if you don’t want to do them all in one go. You decide – I’ll wait…. • determined • economical/good with money • self-confident • innocent • ambitious • assertive • unconventional/original  • frank/direct
Student: determined→I don't know
