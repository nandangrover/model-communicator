Tutor: Thanks - the noun confusion goes with e.g. cause so for example: the mistake caused a great deal of confusion - for traffic we'd say something like 'chaos' maybe as in the accident caused (that verb again - or led to etc) traffic chaos Could you try relief or excitement? I thin k this is useful...
Student: The result of an exam was a relief for me.
Tutor: THanks <STUDENT> - yes, good example and you can say a relief FOR...it's common to say: it was relief to me. Also the phrase is quite common: it came as a relief to me which is maybe less familiar to you (again, with 'familiar' you could say 'for' but 'to' is more normal
Student: OK... I have a lot of things to study today!
Tutor: We can stop there if you like! Give me  a second...(or continue with example if you prefer!
Student: Ah, of course it's OK! His story relieve me.
