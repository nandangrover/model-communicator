Tutor: THat's OK - do you know the word 'nautical'? as in related to the sailing - there are loads of phrases related to this area in English
Student: Oh, I didn't know that word. Maybe that's because the UK is an island country. Sorry, my next example...
Tutor: Yeah - and remember it has a very strong naval tradition - that's what kept the BRitish Empire going for so long! I'll get some examples for our next lesson of common phrases derived from this. OK thanks for your confused example - sorry if it's a sad subject ...but this suggests you didn't understand something....is that true for your example?
Student: Yes, unfortunately it's true and I went back Japan two weeks ago because of this. I was so confused because she was really fine until that day.
Tutor: OK thanks I understand. I think maybe 'shocked' is better here. <STUDENT>, can you give me the missing two words in the following: Iâ€™m optimistic _______ my chances of winning. I was confused ______ the explanation.
Student: I'm optimistic for... and I was confused with...? Ah, I understood that 'shocked' is better.
